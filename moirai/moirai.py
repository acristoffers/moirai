Developer's note:
This script starts the modules as processes for multithreading purposes.
Multithreading in python is broken, so separated processes are necessary. Don't
try to revert to threads. But spawning a new process is made by clonning the
current one. That means that all variables a stuff will be copied (kinda).
Also, when a process spawns another, they all are part of the same process
groupid. When you press CTRL+C, the signal is sent to all processes in the same
groupid. To be able to cleanly exit, child processes need to know their role
and react accordingly to the signal. I do that by making the entry point of
every child process a function in this script (main(pipe, pkg)) that will
flag the process correctly, clean up resources and start the correct run loop.
The lifetime thus becomes:
 - This script starts
 - This script spawns a process
 -- Child process runs `main()` function
 -- Child's `processes` is cleared and `process_type` set to 'child'
 -- Child process enters package main loop
 - User hits CTRL+C, both process receives SIGINT
 -- Child process ignores SIGINT
 - Parent process handles it and sends 'quit' to all children through pipes
 -- Child process receives 'quit' command, cleans up and exits gracefully
 - Parent process waits for all children to terminate and then exits
